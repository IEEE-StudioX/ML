        Cosine Similarity is a metric used to measure the similarity between two vectors.<br>
        It is often used in recommendation systems, text mining, and clustering tasks.<br>
        Cosine similarity calculates the cosine of the angle between two non-zero vectors 
        in a multi-dimensional space. The result is a value between 0 and 1, where:

    <ul>
        <li style="color: rgb(51, 51, 83);">1 indicates that the two vectors are identical (high similarity).</li>
        <li style="color: rgb(51, 51, 83);">0 indicates that the vectors are orthogonal, meaning there is no similarity.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This diagram illustrates how cosine similarity is calculated between vectors.
        The dot product measures the product of the corresponding values of the vectors, 
        while the magnitudes normalize the vectors, ensuring that the result is based purely on 
        their direction, not their magnitude.

        <strong>How Cosine Similarity Works:</strong>
    </p>
    
    <p style="color: rgb(51, 51, 83);">
        1- <strong>Angle Between Vectors:</strong> Cosine similarity is based on the angle between vectors. 
        The closer the angle is to 0 degrees (i.e., the vectors are more aligned), the more similar the vectors are. 
        If the angle is 90 degrees, the vectors are orthogonal, meaning they have no similarity.
    </p>

    <p style="color: rgb(51, 51, 83);">
        2- <strong>Normalization:</strong> Cosine similarity focuses on the orientation (or direction) 
        of the vectors rather than their magnitude. This is useful when the magnitude (such as the number 
        of ratings a user gives) may vary between users, but the patterns of interaction 
        (which movies or items are rated) are what we want to compare.
