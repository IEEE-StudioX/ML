    <h1>Cosine Similarity Explanation</h1>
    <p>
        Cosine Similarity is a metric used to measure the similarity between two vectors.<br>
        It is often used in recommendation systems, text mining, and clustering tasks.<br>
        Cosine similarity calculates the cosine of the angle between two non-zero vectors 
        in a multi-dimensional space. The result is a value between 0 and 1, where:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 indicates that the two vectors are identical (high similarity).</li>
        <li>0 indicates that the vectors are orthogonal, meaning there is no similarity.</li>
    </ul>
